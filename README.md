# EVCSMS - Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management System 

##  About the Project

This is a **Java-based desktop GUI application** that simulates an **Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management System (EVCSMS)**. The system allows operators to:

- Register incoming EVs,
- Log charging sessions,
- Display billing information,
- And manage charging activity efficiently.

It uses **Java Swing** for the GUI and **file handling** for data persistence.

##  Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing (AWT + Swing)
- **Storage:** CSV-based file handling (No DB)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans (any Java IDE)

---

##  Key Concepts Applied

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Event Handling (ActionListener)
- GUI design using Swing (JFrame, JLabel, JButton, etc.), File read/write for data persistence

---

##  What I Learned

- Designing and building a **modular GUI-based application** in Java
- Practical use of **file operations** (read, write, append) in real-world apps
- Implementing **event-driven programming** with responsive interfaces
- Parsing doubles to strings and vice versa safely and cleanly
- HTML content rendering inside Java Swing (for output formatting)
- Managing records through CSV: **Add**, **Retrieve**, **Delete**
- Organizing logic into multiple classes for maintainability
- Importance of comments and readable structure for real-world teamwork

---

##  Testing

- Manual testing done for all features
- Input validation checks
- Visual interface tested for various screen sizes and inputs
